---------------------------
A utility for running queries and unit tests on queries and functions. Returns with exit code 0 if all tests passed, code 1 otherwise. 

See more detailed documentation at: https://github.com/PhysiciansDataCollaborative/queries

**This must be executed from the root directory of the queries repository.**

Usage: 
    js test [type] [-q] [PATTERN] 

    Where [type] is one of "queries", "functions", or "".

Example Usage:
    js test  //runs tests for queries and functions

    OR:
    js test -q  //for suppressing output. 

    OR:
    js test queries <pattern>  //matches against directives of type QUERY and runs those that have names that match the pattern.. 

    OR:
    js test functions <pattern>  //finds directives that are for functions, only run those that match pattern.

Arguments:
    
    -q      Suppress output, useful if running this as part of a build process.

Notes:
    - If you are receving error messages about JavaScript not being
        able to open files try changing paths to:  './<path>'
    - Ignore errors regarding bson import, these are related to a C++ binary version of BSON being unavailable, the JS version is sufficient for this test utility.
