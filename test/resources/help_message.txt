Help Message:
---------------------------
A utility for running queries and unit tests on queries. Returns with exit code 0 if all tests passed, code 1 otherwise. 

See more detailed documentation at: https://github.com/PhysiciansDataCollaborative/queries

**This must be executed from the root directory of the queries repository.**

Usage: 
    js test [-q] [PATTERN] 

Example Usage:
    js test

    OR:
    js test -q  //for suppressing output. 

    OR:
    js test <regex>  //matches against directive file names and only run those. 


Arguments:
    
    -q      Suppress output, useful if running this as part of a build process.

Notes:
    - If you are receving error messages about JavaScript not being
        able to open files try changing paths to:  './<path>'
    - Ignore errors regarding bson import, these are related to a C++ binary version of BSON being unavailable, the JS version is sufficient for this test utility.
